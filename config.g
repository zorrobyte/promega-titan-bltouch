; --- SECTION: Z-PROBE & MESH COMPENSATION ---
; Determine the Probe Z Offset:
;  1. Heat the bed to 60C and the nozzle to 150C
;  2. Move the head near the center with G1 X200 Y200
;  3. Move the bed near the nozzle with G1 Z20
;  4. Disable the bed mesh with G29 S2, do this twice
; ---- DISABLE AXIS LIMITS M564 S0
;  5. Move the bed in small steps so it just touches the nozzle, 1mm steps first, then 0.1mm steps
;  6. Set the Z0 position with G92 Z0
;  7. Move the bed back to Z20, with G1 Z20
;  8. Deploy the probe if necessary
;  9. Get the Z Probe value with G30 S-1
; 10. Note the Z value in the Web UI and update it in the G31 Z parameter below
; 11. Put the Z probe away if necessary
